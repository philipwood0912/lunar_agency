    bio: "My name is Scott Olthoff. I am 21 years old, live in London, Ontario, and I am head of motion design at Lunar Media. My job is to take a client's company, and bring it to life. My goal is to represent clients, what they do, their values, and much more through video, animation, and other forms of motion. Just check out the video above, that was all me. I love motion design and my favourite part is working with special effects. Outside of work, I enjoy listening to music, binge-watching Netflix and Amazon Prime shows and movies, and thrifting (only got $20 in my pocket)."
