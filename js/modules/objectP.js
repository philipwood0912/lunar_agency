    bio: "Hi, my name is Philip Wood and I'm currently aiming to become a back-end developer. JavaScript is currently my favorite language when it comes to web development. I'm taking a keen interest in PHP / MySQL and cannot wait to learn more about them. Problem solving is something that I find really fun and rewarding once solved."
